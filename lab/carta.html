    <h2>Subjects od study</h2>
    <div>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - As long as the Subjects fall somewhere in the realm of cience and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas you sumitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect of performance of funk bassplayers of temperatures exceding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>> 3x10<sup>4</sup> )</li>
            <li>HTML an CSS constructs for representing musical scores</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So pleace can you provide    more information on each of these Subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, requiered staff and other resouerces, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, you are rigth! as part of my post-doctorate work, i <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions</p>
        <p>Polynesian chicken dance <dd>A little kownbut <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Back Chirst">BC</abbr>, a whole village  would dance around in a circle like chikens, to encourage their livestock or be "friutful". </dd></p>
        <p>Icelanding bwornian shuffle <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means, of getting warm, they use to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow studentsused to say that  he thougt this  danced inspired modern styles such as Twerking</dd></p>
        <p>Artic Robot Dance <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English Exprores in the 1960s belivied to have discovered a new dance style charasterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhaabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on howeverit was doscovered that they were just moving like this because the were really cold.</dd></p>
    </div>
    <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="">exotic dance research page.</a></p>
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
